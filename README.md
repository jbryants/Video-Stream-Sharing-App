# Video-Stream-Sharing-App

A video stream sharing app where you can stream videos using the streaming software on your computer and others can view it live using this web app.

You can find it live here:

Warning:
The RTMP server needed for streaming video content is not deployed, 
so the streaming feature can't be seen live, 
though you can play around with creating, updating and deleting streams.
